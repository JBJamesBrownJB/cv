My career has evolved in 6 parts. I believe describing this journey along with links to examples of my work is the best way to communicate it.

# Part 1: High throughput, low latency, distrbuted, event driven data
Joining a sports betting tech company startup with 30 people in a warehouse in Kentish Town and leaving it 13 years later with 1000+ people across global offices and watching it float on the NY stock exchange for $1.5 billion. Coding, architecting and leading teams to build distributed systems processing over one hundred thousand of messages a second with latencies ranging from sub-second to nanoseconds, I write about how I grew to learn both [mechanical and human sympathy here](https://medium.com/@jameskinnahbrown/sympathy-an-essential-ingredient-to-our-microservice-strategy-554d22f0c98e). Our data platforms were industry leading and our agility to react and deliver made us one of the most competative sports data tech companies in the world. We valued simplicity over complexity, collaboration over process, experiementation through fail fast/learn early attitudes and dedication to excellence in engineering. Me and my teams systems were always delivered on time and over-exceeded expectations, most of them still run today powering the backend for many well know sports betting platforms.

Our secret sauce:
- TDD, actual TDD, red/green/refactor on <i>everything</i> we built
- Pairing
- Autonomous Teams, we architect it, we build, we run it, we get out of bed when it explodes

We also built alot of things that whilst exceptional in their engineering, nobody wanted. It was with this learning I looked towards product-led engineering approaches and moved to ThoughtWorks.

# Part 2: ThoughtWorks engineer
Long admirer of ThoughtWorks of their influence in the engineering craft and attitude towards social justice I took and opportunity to work with some of the most humble yet brilliant engineers and leaders I have ever met. My time at ThoughtWorks saw me delivering and coding in new languages and technologies from java, kotlin, python, rust, terraform, react, vuejs and more. As a hands on team lead we delived on time and exceeding expectations every time.

Our secret sauce:
- TDD
- Pairing
- Autonomous Teams
+ <b>Continuous Deployment</b>
+ <b>DORA metrics driven</b>
+ <b>Trunk based development</b>

You can see some of my code [here](https://github.com/JBJamesBrownJB/system-register) for a simple event-sourcing based crowd sourced risk tool we produced for the UK Home Office. As a team we were quick to adopt the emerging DORA metrics and quickly attained elite metrics.

# Part 2: ThoughtWorks contributor
ThoughtWorks' vibrant and dynamic community allowed me to set up an [open-source project](https://github.com/BMMRO-tech/BMMRO), creating an application for marine scientists in the Bahamas to conduct research at sea. An initial team provided over a million pounds of free technology using React and Firebase, facilitating periodically connected devices to digitalize their workflow. Now on its fourth iteration, the project continues to bring value to research teams. Although I never contributed a line of code for this project, I recognized my strength in not just delivering great technology but delivering <i>teams</i> that could do the same. I began speaking at international conferences to hone my public speaking skills and articulate the methods and principles I hold dear. My talks took me to places like Morocco, [Sweden](https://youtu.be/kMWQkJ3FAxA?si=tlcfScchmebeeC-e), Norway, London, and [Milan](https://talks.codemotion.com/big-estimates-with-graph-theory?view=true). I might not consider myself a stellar speaker yet, but attendees often find my presentations engaging, or at least entertaining.

# Part 4: ThoughtWorks Leader
Seizing a leadership opportunity, I filled the role as Head of Technology for Europe's premier ed-tech company aiming to rejuvenate its market presence. Despite a team of 200 developers, they hadn't launched a new product in 8 years and were losing their 75% market share at 10% annually. Within a year, we released their first new product to rave reviews. By 18 months, we had four more products and underpinned by a dynamic distributed, decentralised data platform integrating the cloud and on-premise school systems realtime. This enabled us to both delvier new cloud based SaaS experiences across devices but by also employing ThoughtWorks' emerging Data-Mesh strategy, we innovated with data in novel ways that started to address the competition of cross school data analyitcs. The big plus is our system built with learnings from my past operated real-time in seconds, challanging the competitions batch based systems. By the time I moved on, seven autonomous prodect led teams each with elite DORA metrics were rapidly deliverying new features and products to schools and collaborating on a shared data strategy to build an emerging foundational internal platform, demostrably further accelerateing the pace of value delivery.

Our secret sauce:
- TDD
- Pairing
- Continuous Deployment
- DORA metrics driven
- Trunk based development
+ <b>Product led autonomous teams</b>
+ <b>Data Mesh</b>

This opportunity of building and leading high performing teams at an aggressive scale and pace feels like my future, however, because it leaves no time for deep hands on coding, I find my coding skills becoming rusty and missing latest language features. I can still code, but its not the same as when I was practicing it daily on production level systems. Though, I know that with a few months I could re-master that skill if I wanted to.

# Part 5: The City
Taking my experience of transforming struggling technology companies I took the opportunity to practice it in a 200 year old bank, an asset management company with over $600 billion AUM, because what could be harder? Schroders are looking for an ambitious transformation of their engineering culture, organisation and approach. Joining the Enterprise team we look to steer them to a dynamic vibrant technology future...I can't talk about it much more than that as it is in-progress and sensetive.

Our potential secret sauce:

...I think you can spot a pattern :)
